#progressive english

A dictionary and style guide by <u>Benjamin Russel Shoemake</u> ([@literallybenjam](http://twitter.com/literallybenjam)). Aiming to subvert the Oxfordarchy, shape the language, and have fun.

<i>Progressive english</i> is prescriptive in the sense that it does more than just describe the way things currently work&mdash;it actively attempts to shape the way that the language functions. But it is also just one in a series of style guides, and discretion is left to the speakers to determine how much, if any, of its features they seek to use. <i>Progressive english</i> will change with the times. It's hosted on GitHub, so its history is always available.
