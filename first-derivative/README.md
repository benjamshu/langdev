# THE LANGUAGE : FIRST DERIVATIVE

The first level of evolution and abstraction from the initial PROTO-LANGUAGE. The first derivative helps to normalize the phonology of THE LANGUAGE and give it a unique character. The following general shifts and changes are recorded:

## phonological changes:

1.  when a long vowel is followed by a consonant, an <i>e</i> is added to the end (<i>bau:zh</i> > <i>báu:zhe</i>)

2.  when a long vowel is followed by stop onset, the length of the stop is doubled and the vowel is shortened (<i>arbí:tu</i> > <i>arbíttu</i>)

3.  other long diphthongs are palatalized (<i>au:</i> > <i>auw</i>, <i>ai:</i> > <i>aij</i>, <i>ua:</i> > <i>uaj</i>, <i>oi:</i> > <i>oij</i>)

4.  when a syllable coda contains a <i>w</i> or <i>j</i> followed by another consonant, the second consonant is moved into the onset of a new syllable with vowel <i>e</i>

5.  <i>j</i> becomes <i>je</i> when followed by a nasal

6.  word-final <i>q</i> is dropped when not preceded by another consonant

7.  <i>gq</i> becomes <i>q</i>

8.  <i>r</i> is dropped when preceded by (palato-)alveolar consonants

9.  Unaccented <i>e</i> becomes <i>/ə/</i>; accented <i>e</i> becomes <i>/e/</i>

10. Several chain shifts occur:

    * <i>gq</i> > <i>g</i> > <i>k</i> > <i>x</i>
    * <i>zh</i> > <i>z</i> (<i>/ʑ/</i>)
    * <i>sh</i> > <i>s</i> (<i>/ɕ/</i>)

11. Accent is moved to the first syllable of all words

## grammatical/morphological changes:

1.  <i>-e:qg</i> becomes a marker for the habitual aspect

2.  <i>-ug</i> now carries the meaning "become"
