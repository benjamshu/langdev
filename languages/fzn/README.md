# FIZONAL LANGUAGES #

THE FIZONAL LANGUAGES are a language family built up from PROTO-FIZONAL.
They get their title from a corruption of the ENGLISH word “fictional”.
The most complete of these is FIZENG, which you can find [here](fiz), for which development began in 2014.

A revision and expansion of FIZENG, as well as the development of an entirely new language, has been launched now in 2016.
