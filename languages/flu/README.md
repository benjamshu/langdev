#  FLUîNE  #

While other LANGDEV languages have been rather rigid and structured (oftentimes due to their reliance on a moraic orthography), the FLUîNE family of languages aims to be highly fluid and lyrical.
Development of a language with this sort of character is especially difficult, since derivation of new words may not follow as rigid or predictable of rules, and many aspects of the language (such as phonology) are difficult to record in easily documentable form.

##  Design principles:  ##

###  multiple valid ways of saying things  ###

The poetic nature of FLUîNE requires having several grammatical structures co-existing, which can be chosen between for effect.
This requires __multiple ancestor languages__ with __varied grammatical structures__.

###  "fluid" orthography and phonology  ###

The pronunciation of morphemes varies widely depending on those which precede/follow them.
This extends even across word boundaries. In addition, level of ellision may serve as a modal marker.
This is preserved in the orthography, which sometimes recoreds letters and sometimes leaves them out.
A complex set of ligatures mirrors the complex phonological rules of the language.

###  enabling of ellision  ###

Grammatical structures are designed to let large numbers of words be inferred from context.
In some cases, this may have progressed to the point where inclusion/exculsion of words affects sentence meaning.
