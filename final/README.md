# THE LANGUAGE : FINAL

This folder chronicles the real-world use of THE LANGUAGE. Most, if not all, words found here can also be found in the RC lexicon. However, the words and grammars recorded here must be tracable to some canonical implementation of THE LANGUAGE; for example, [http://learn.斤丸舌.com](learn.斤丸舌.com).

Because they have extant real-world instances, the words and grammars recorded here are beyond revision.
