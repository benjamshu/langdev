##  Devoiced:  ##

- ㄲ /k/

##  Aspirated:  ##

- ㅋ /kʰ/

- ㅊ /tɕʰ/
- ㅍ /pʰ/

Note that aspirated letters are used for devoiced codas.
In addition, five double-consonant codas are possible:

- ㄺ /ɾg/
- ㄻ /ɾv/
- ㄾ /ɾt/
- ㄼ /ɾb/
- ㄿ /ɾp/

These come from ㄹ's originary purpose as an affix boundary.
The second consonant sound is not pronounced when word-final, unless the following word begins with a vowel.
