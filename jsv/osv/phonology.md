#  CLASSICAL SEVENSI :: PHONOLOGY  #

(This document uses a Latin orthography to record Sevensi phonologies; see ORTHOGRAPHY for IPA equivalencies.)

Classical Sevensian sounds can be distinguished based on three attributes: location (front, mid, back), quality (stop, fricative, approximant, nasal, vowel), and voicing (voiced, unvoiced).
The following table outlines the potential combinations:

|     quality | back  |  mid  | front |
| ----------: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
|        stop |  g/k  |  d/t  |  b/p  |
|   fricative |  x/h  |  z/s  |  v/f  |
| approximant |   y   |  j/c  |   w   |
|       nasal |   q   |   n   |   m   |
|       vowel |   a   |   æ   |   e   |

Note that the distinction between voiced and unvoiced consonants was probably not pronounced in most instances in Classical Sevensi X.

##  Vowels  ##

In addition to the core vowels listed above, the approximants *y* and *w* may be combined with the vowels to produce new forms.
In general, *w* rounds the vowel and *y* iotizes it; *æ* forms a special case, as it is dropped in these instances (so *æy* > *i*).
Rounded vowels *can* be iotized (but not vice versa), so *awy* is valid (but *ayw* is not).

For clarity, modified vowels are given special representations:

|  0  | +y  | +w  | +wy |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|  a  |  ai |  å  |  åi |
|  æ  |  i  |  u  |  ui |
|  e  |  ei |  o  |  oi |
