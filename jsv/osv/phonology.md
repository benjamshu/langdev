#  CLASSICAL SEVENSI :: PHONOLOGY  #

(This document uses a Latin orthography to record Sevensi phonologies; see ORTHOGRAPHY for IPA equivalencies.)

Classical Sevensian sounds can be distinguished based on three attributes: location (front, mid, back), quality (stop, fricative, approximant, nasal, vowel), and voicing (voiced, unvoiced).
The following table outlines the potential combinations:

|     quality | back  |  mid  | front |
| ----------: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
|        stop |  g/k  |  d/t  |  b/p  |
|   fricative |  x/h  |  z/s  |  v/f  |
| approximant |   y   |  j/c  |   w   |
|       nasal |   q   |   n   |   m   |
|       vowel |   a   |   æ   |   e   |

Note that the distinction between voiced and unvoiced consonants was probably not pronounced in most instances in Classical Sevensi X.

##  Vowels  ##

In addition to the core vowels listed above, the approximants *y* and *w* may be combined with the vowels to produce new forms.
In general, *w* rounds the vowel and *y* iotizes it; *æ* forms a special case, as it is dropped in these instances (so *æy* > *i*).
Rounded vowels *can* be iotized (but not vice versa), so *awy* is valid (but *ayw* is not).

For clarity, modified vowels are given special representations:

|  0  | +y  | +w  | +wy |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|  a  |  ai |  å  |  åi |
|  æ  |  i  |  u  |  ui |
|  e  |  ei |  o  |  oi |

The following table charts the evolution of Sevensi phonology in the time leading up to and during the Classical period:

###  Notes  ###

1. If the consonant is preceeded by a voiced consonant in the same syllable, devoice it.
    Otherwise, if the following syllable begins with *h*, the consonant is devoiced and the *h* is dropped.
    Otherwise, if the syllable is stressed, the consonant is voiced.
    Otherwise, if the syllable is preceeded by an unstressed syllable or a stop which is more front, the consonant is devoiced.
    Otherwise the consonant is voiced.
2. *\*t* becomes *r* when unstressed, syllable-final, or followed by *\*ei*, *\*ô*, or *\*au*.
    Other instances of *\*t* are voiced as *d*.
3. *\*z* becomes *j* when the preceeding syllable is stressed.
4. *\*f* becomes *v* when stressed and morpheme-initial
5. *\*l* becomes *r* unless preceeded by a stressed syllable
6. *n* becomes *q* when syllable-final and unstressed
7. Iotized when stressed and the preceeding consonant is null, *\*m*, *\*f*, *\*p*, *\*d*, *\*t*
8. Iotized when stressed
9. *\*î* becomes *y* in places where a consonant would make sense

- VIV *\*ds* becomes X *j* and VIV *\*st* becomes X *z*
- X *dw* and *tw* become XI *j* and *c*, respectively, when word-initial.
- X *å* tends towards XI *a* after front consonants, and the reverse is true after back consonants
- X *VVi* > XI *VyV*
