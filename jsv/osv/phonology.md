#  CLASSICAL SEVENSI :: PHONOLOGY  #

(This document uses a Latin orthography to record Sevensi phonologies; see ORTHOGRAPHY for IPA equivalencies.)

Classical Sevensian sounds can be distinguished based on three attributes: location (front, mid, back), quality (stop, fricative, approximant, nasal, vowel), and voicing (voiced, unvoiced).
The following table outlines the potential combinations:

|     quality | back  |  mid  | front |
| ----------: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
|        stop |  g/k  | d/t l |  b/p  |
|       nasal |   q   |   n   |   m   |
|   fricative |  x/h  |z/s j/c|  v/f  |
| approximant |   r   |   y   |   w   |
|       vowel |   a   |   æ   |   e   |

Note that the distinction between voiced and unvoiced consonants was probably not pronounced in most instances in Classical Sevensi X.

##  Vowels  ##

In addition to the core vowels listed above, the approximants *y* and *w* may be combined with the vowels to produce new forms.
In general, *w* rounds the vowel and *y* iotizes it; *æ* forms a special case, as it is dropped in these instances (so *æy* > *i*).
Rounded vowels *can* be iotized (but not vice versa), so *awy* is valid (but *ayw* is not).

For clarity, modified vowels are given special representations:

|  0  | +y  | +w  | +wy |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|  a  |  ai |  å  |  åi |
|  æ  |  i  |  u  |  ui |
|  e  |  ei |  o  |  oi |

###  Notes  ###

1. If the consonant is preceeded by a voiced consonant in the same syllable, devoice it.
    Otherwise, if the following syllable begins with _h_, the consonant is devoiced and the _h_ is dropped.
    Otherwise, if the syllable is stressed, the consonant is voiced.
    Otherwise, if the syllable is preceeded by an unstressed syllable or a stop which is more front, the consonant is devoiced.
    Otherwise the consonant is voiced.

2. _\*t_ becomes _l_ when unstressed, syllable-final, or followed by _\*ei_, _\*ô_, or _\*au_.
    Other instances of _\*t_ are voiced as _d_.

3. _\*z_ becomes _j_ when the preceeding syllable is stressed.

4. _\*f_ becomes _v_ when stressed and morpheme-initial or word-final.

5. _\*l_ becomes _tl_ when preceeded by a stressed syllable.

6. _n_ becomes _q_ when syllable-final and unstressed.

7. Iotized when stressed and the preceeding consonant is null, _\*m_, _\*f_, _\*p_, _\*d_, _\*t_.

8. Iotized when stressed.

9. _\*î_ becomes _y_ in places where a consonant would make sense.

- VIV _\*ds_ becomes X _j_ and VIV _\*st_ becomes X _z_.

- X _dw_ and _tw_ become XI _j_ and _c_, respectively, when word-initial.

- X _å_ tends towards XI _a_ after front consonants, and the reverse is true after back consonants.

- X _VVi_ > XI _VyV_.
