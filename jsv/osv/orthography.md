#  CLASSICAL SEVENSI :: ORTHOGRAPHY  #

There are a variety of orthographical systems for recording Classical Sevensi, all of which are employed to some extent here.
The most common and easiest to read is the Latin transliteration, which preserves the vast majority of features of the consturcted phonology.
Due to the syllabic nature of the language, and its employment of vowel harmony, a Hangul orthographical system exists as well, and is equally proficient at preserving phonological distinctions.
The International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) is, of course, used where explicit phonological transcription is required.

The writing systems actually employed during the construction of Classical Sevensi works were far less precise.
The originary script of Classical Sevensi was a logosyllabary; language reform during the late Classical period led to the adoption of an abjad.
The letters of the Classical Sevensian abjad may sometimes be referred to as *runes*; although the writing system is unrelated to that of the runic alphabets, the letters bear a rough visual resemblance and can appear in similar contexts.

The Classical Sevensian abjad is planned to be specified in the LANGDEV Project private-use block U+101100..U+10110F CLASSICAL SEVENSI RUNES according to the following code descriptions:

- U+101100 CLASSICAL SEVENSI LETTER G
- U+101101 CLASSICAL SEVENSI LETTER NG
- U+101102 CLASSICAL SEVENSI LETTER X
- U+101103 CLASSICAL SEVENSI LETTER D
- U+101104 CLASSICAL SEVENSI LETTER N
- U+101105 CLASSICAL SEVENSI LETTER Z
- U+101106 CLASSICAL SEVENSI LETTER J
- U+101107 CLASSICAL SEVENSI LETTER B
- U+101108 CLASSICAL SEVENSI LETTER M
- U+101109 CLASSICAL SEVENSI LETTER V
- U+10110A CLASSICAL SEVENSI LETTER Y
- U+10110B CLASSICAL SEVENSI LETTER L
- U+10110C CLASSICAL SEVENSI LETTER W
- U+10110D CLASSICAL SEVENSI POSITIVE HARMONY MARK
- U+10110E CLASSICAL SEVENSI NEGATIVE HARMONY MARK
- U+10110F CLASSICAL SEVENSI PUNCTUATION

In later texts, U+10110F CLASSICAL SEVENSI PUNCTUATION is placed between words to separate them.
Otherwise, U+200C ZERO WIDTH NON-JOINER should be placed between words which carry the same harmony.
