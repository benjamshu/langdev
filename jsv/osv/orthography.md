#  CLASSICAL SEVENSI :: ORTHOGRAPHY  #

CLASSICAL SEVENSI is recorded here (with the exception of CLASSICAL SEVENSI VIV, which should not be considered a member of the language-family) using korean hangul.
This closely mirrors the important aspects of CLASSICAL SEVENSI's hypothetical alphabetic writing system, including vowel-harmony and consonant-families.
However, it is important to note that this alphabetic writing system was only introduced near the end of CLASSICAL SEVENSI's life, and earlier forms of the language would have been written in the ideographic writing system which preceeded it.
