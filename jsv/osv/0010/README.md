#  CLASSICAL SEVENSI X  #

The first level of evolution and abstraction from JASTU-SEVENSI VIV; in which the grammars are formalized and the phonology is brought better under control.

##  Changes from VIV and previous:  ##

Note that, in CLASSICAL SEVENSI VIV, the second-to-last syllable of the word-root is always stressed.

###  gramatical gender and nasalization  ###

In JÄSTŪGĀ/JÄSTŪGEI VIII, a nasalized *ā* sound was used to indicate feminine connotations in a small subset of words.
These feminine connotations were largely removed in VIV, and the nasalization was detached into a word-final *-ng*.
CLASSICAL SEVENSI lacks any grammatical gender and this nasalization pattern has expanded to other syllables.

###  codas  ###

Syllable codas may now include any letter in the orthography.
Syllable codas are limited to a single letter, with the exception of *&#x11AF;*, which may be followed another in some circumstances.
(This comes from *&#x11AF;*'s original purpose as an affix-separator.)
In word-final compound codas, the second letter is not pronounced.

###  splits, merges, and drops  ###

####  m/n merge

The sound \*m has merged with \*n as *ㄴ*.

####  t split

\*t has shifted to *ㄹ* when unstressed, syllable-final, or followed by \*ei, \*ô, or \*au.
Other instances of \*t are preserved as *ㄸ*.

####  w merge/drop

\*w becomes *ㄴ* when word-initial, and otherwise makes the preceeding syllable a W-form, if possible, or rounded, if not.

####  z/ʒ merge

\*z and \*ʒ have merged as *ㅅ*.

####  iotization

When the first syllable of a word is stressed, it is iotized.
Iotization also occurs in instances of consecutive vowels (that is, a syllable with no coda followed by another with no onset) as a means of concatenation when the first vowel is \*â, \*ê, or \*î.
Additionally, \*aiV, \*eiV, and \*oiV become \*ajV, \*ejV, and \*ojV, respectively.

####  vowel shifts

\*ei becomes *ㅔ* when unstressed.
\*â becomes *ㅐ* when stressed and the preceeding consonant is null, labial, or coronal (\*s, \*z, and \*ʒ not included).
\*ô becomes *ㅚ* when stressed.

####  consonant-family splits

The consonants \*d, \*g, \*j, \*p, and \*x are split into voiced, aspirated, and devoiced forms, according to the following rules:

1. If the following syllable begins with \*h, the consonant is aspirated and the \*h is dropped.
2. Otherwise, if the syllable is stressed, the consonant is voiced.
3. Otherwise, if the syllable is preceeded by an unstressed syllable, the consonant is aspirated.
4. Otherwise, the consonant is devoiced.

Note that these rules are somewhat flexible, especially when dealing with affixes.

####  harmonization

Words are now harmonized according to the polarity of their stressed syllable.
Words whose stressed syllable is neutral are not harmonized.

## Orthography: ##

CLASSICAL SEVENSI uses korean hangul (including some archaic forms) as its writing system.
Some sounds have changed to match sevensian phonology.
