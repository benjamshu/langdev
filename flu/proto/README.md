#  PROTO-FLUÃ®NE  #

PROTO-FLUÃ®NE aims to provide the core roots, phonological systems, and grammars for the FLUÃ®NE family of languages.

##  Phonology:  ##

Words in PROTO-FLUÃ®NE are differentiated based on consonant sounds and a pitch-accent system; there are no distinct vowels.
As such, these are not recorded.
However, vowels are inserted when necessary while speaking like so: kt -> ket, where "e" is some generic vowel.
Where vowels are and aren't inserted is fluid; they may be included for emphasis or left out when speaking quickly.
The pitch-accent system also influences vowel inclusion: for example, you might have stn -> sten but **st**n -> **ste**ne and s**t**n -> se**te**ne.
