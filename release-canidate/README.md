# THE LANGUAGE : RELEASE CANIDATE

The final stage of LANGUAGE development, ready to be used in the real world. Final adoption is dependent on external factors; this stage is not beyond revision but aims to be largely static.

For the most part, these words will be very similar to D2, but some minor changes may occur. In addition, the RELEASE-CANIDATE lexicon will contain a much higher number of foreign words.
