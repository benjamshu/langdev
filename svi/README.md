# THE SEVENSI LANGUAGES #

THE SEVENSI LANGUAGES get their title from the fact that they were initially developed for use in a story-project I was working on, codenamed `7C`.
*Highly* generative, they were my first attempt at a geographically- and culturally-independent language.
Initial development took place from 2009-2012; you can find lexicons from this period in [the !DEPRECIATED! folder](!DEPRECIATED!).

In 2015, the lexicons generated during this early development were combined into a new [PROTO-LEXICON](proto), and development began anew.


##  Roadmap:  ##

- "Classical" :
    - VIV : Regional variant
    - X : Grammatical standardization
    - XI : Phonological standardization
    - XII : Release-candidate
- "Vernacular" :
    - XII : Slightly different tack from "Classical"
    - XIII : Grammatical simplifications
    - XIV : Release-candidate
- "Modern" :
    - XV : Release-canidate; final grammars and phonology
