#  SEVENSI FIRST-IN-DEVELOPMENT X  #

The first level of evolution and abstraction from PROTO-SEVENSI; in which the grammars are formalized and the phonology is brought better under control.

##  Changes from VIV and previous:  ##

###  gramatical gender and nasalization  ###

In JÄSTŪGĀ/JÄSTŪGEI VIII, a nasalized *ā* sound was used to indicate feminine connotations in a small subset of words.
These feminine connotations were largely removed in VIV, and the nasalization was detached into a word-final *-ng*.
SEVENSI FIRST-IN-DEVELOPMENT lacks any grammatical gender and this nasalization pattern has expanded to other syllables.

###  splits and merges  ###

The sounds *m* and *w* have merged, recorded with the letter *ㅁ*.
Some instances of *m* have instead split off as a new consonant, *n* which retains the traditional letter (*ㄴ*).

The sounds *z* and *zh* have merged as /ʑ/, recorded with the letter *ㅈ*.
*j* has shifted to /dʑ/, retaining its orthography.

*v* has been devoiced and merged orthographically with *f* under *ㅍ*.

Some instances of *t* have split off as *r*, recored with *ㄹ*.
This remains *l* in the word-final position, and is sometimes pronounced /tl/ in the middle of words.

###  codas  ###

Syllable codas may now include any letter in the orthography.
Note that *ㅇ*, normally null, represents *ng* in the coda.
Syllable codas are limited to a single letter, with the exception of *ㄹ*, which may be followed another in some circumstances.
(This comes from *ㄹ*'s original purpose as an affix-separator.)

## Orthography: ##

SEVENSI FIRST-IN-DEVELOPMENT uses korean hangul as its writing system. Some sounds have changed to match sevensian phonology.
