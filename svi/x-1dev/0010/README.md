#  SEVENSI FIRST-IN-DEVELOPMENT X  #

The first level of evolution and abstraction from PROTO-SEVENSI; in which the grammars are formalized and the phonology is brought better under control.

##  Changes from VIV and previous:  ##

###  gramatical gender and nasalization  ###

In JÄSTŪGĀ/JÄSTŪGEI VIII, a nasalized *ā* sound was used to indicate feminine connotations in a small subset of words.
These feminine connotations were largely removed in VIV, and the nasalization was detached into a word-final *-ng*.
SEVENSI FIRST-IN-DEVELOPMENT lacks any grammatical gender and this nasalization pattern has expanded to other syllables.

###  splits and merges  ###

The sound \*m has shifted to /n/ in many cases.
The sounds \*z and \*zh have merged as /ʑ/, while \*j has shifted to /dʑ/.
\*f has been voiced in many cases and merged with /v/.
Some instances of \*t have split off as /ɾ/.
This remains /l/ in the word-final position, and is sometimes pronounced /tl/ in the middle of words.

The consonants \*g, \*d, \*p, \*j now have voiced, unvoiced, and aspirated forms.
\*h has largely been dropped, while \*x has been devoiced in many instances as /h/.

The vowel \*au has evolved to /ɒ/.

###  codas  ###

Syllable codas may now include any letter in the orthography.
Note that *ㅇ*, normally null, represents *ng* in the coda.
Syllable codas are limited to a single letter, with the exception of *ㄹ*, which may be followed another in some circumstances.
(This comes from *ㄹ*'s original purpose as an affix-separator.)
In word-final compound codas, the second letter is not pronounced.

## Orthography: ##

SEVENSI FIRST-IN-DEVELOPMENT uses korean hangul as its writing system. Some sounds have changed to match sevensian phonology.
