# THE LANGUAGE : SECOND DERIVATIVE

The second level of evolution and abstraction from the initial PROTO-LANGUAGE. The second derivative helps to simplify THE PROTO-LANGUAGE and make it easier to write.

## phonological changes

Syllable stress is shifted to the first syllable of all roots. In addition, there are *many* consonant merges:

*   <b><i>f</i>~<i>h</i> :</b>

    The following syllables are produced: <i>ha</i>, <i>he</i>, <i>fi</i>, <i>ho</i>, <i>fu</i>.

*   <b><i>s</i>~<i>z</i> :</b>

    In the onsets of stressed syllables, <i>z</i>; in codas, <i>s</i>. In the onsets of unstressed syllables, <i>z</i> when following <i>i</i>, <i>o</i>, or <i>s</i>/<i>z</i>; <i>s</i> otherwise.

*   <b><i>d</i>~<i>r</i> :</b>

    Pronounced <i>r</i> following any vowel; pronounced <i>d</i> otherwise.

*   <b><i>n</i>~<i>q</i> :</b>

    The resulting nasal is pronounced as <i>q</i> when the preceeding consonant (if present, often in a preceeding syllable) is one of the following: <i>g</i>, <i>k</i>, <i>h</i> (but __not__ <i>f</i>), <i>s</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>w</i>; pronounced <i>n</i> otherwise.

Finally, when a syllable ending in <i>i</i> is followed by one beginning with <i>y</i>, the <i>i</i> is not pronounced; the same holds true for <i>w</i> and <i>u</i>

## changes in syntax

The number of irregular verbs is reduced, and the conjugation-system is simplified and perfected. Classifiers are consolidated and become a closed grammatical class.

## orthography

The character-based system of writing of D1 is consolidated into a syllabary. Some characters are reserved for use in grammatical words, to make reading easier, although these may be grandfathered in with some lexical words.
