# FIZONAL LANGUAGES #

The fizonal languages are a language family built up from PROTO-FIZONAL. The most complete of these is FIZENG, which you can find [here](斤丸舌).

Documentation is FORTHCOMING, promise; you can get ahold of me at [@literallybenjam](http://twitter.com/literallybenjam) if you need info before then.
