# FLUîNE #

While other LANGDEV languages have been rather rigid and structured (oftentimes due to their reliance on a moraic orthography), the FLUîNE family of languages aims to be highly fluid and lyrical.
Development of a language with this sort of character is especially difficult, since derivation of new words may not follow as rigid or predictable of rules, and many aspects of the language (such as phonology) are difficult to record in easily documentable form.
