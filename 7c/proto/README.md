# PROTO-SEVENSI #

PROTO-SEVENSI serves to provide the core roots, grammars, and systems for development of the SEVENSI family of languages.
It may be effectively utilized as a core for the development of sibling languages or for educational purposes.
This document serves as a reference for various aspects of PROTO-SEVENSI and its development.

PROTO-SEVENSI is derived from a collection of independent languages developed between 2009 and 2012.
You can find those [here](../!DEPRECIATED!).

Because it defines a proto-language, this document should be considered speculative, third-hand, and for reference purposes only.
