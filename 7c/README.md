# THE SEVENSI LANGUAGES #

THE SEVENSI LANGUAGES get their title from the fact that they were initially developed for use in a story-project I was working on, codenamed `7C`.
*Highly* generative, they were my first attempt at a geographically- and culturally-independent language.
Initial development took place from 2009-2012; you can find lexicons from this period in [the !DEPRECIATED! folder](!DEPRECIATED!).

In 2015, the lexicons generated during this early development were combined into a new [PROTO-LEXICON](proto), and development began anew.
