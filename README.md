## description

~~THE LANGUAGE is a linguistic project to create a fictitious language not bound to any geographic region or culture. See [home.benjam.xyz/langdev](http://home.benjam.xyz/langdev) for more human-readable information.~~ This is now outdated! Documentation is FORTHCOMING, promise; you can get ahold of me at [@literallybenjam](http://twitter.com/literallybenjam) if you need info before then.

The !DEPRECIATED! folder contains previous language attempts and information that is no longer relevant. The !DATA! folder contains tools and computer-data. The remaining folders contain information pertaining to THE LANGUAGE proper.

All files published to the master branch at [http://github.com/literallybenjam/langdev](http://github.com/literallybenjam/langdev) are, to the extent possible under law, in the public domain. For more information, see [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md).
