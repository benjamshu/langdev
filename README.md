LANGDEV uses [LexisML](https://github.com/literallybenjam/LexisML) to keep track of languages' lexicons.

All files published to the master branch at [http://github.com/literallybenjam/langdev](http://github.com/literallybenjam/langdev) are, to the extent possible under law, in the public domain. For more information, see [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md).
