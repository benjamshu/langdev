# The LANGDEV Project #

GitHub repo for all language development by [@literallybenjam](http://twitter.com/literallybenjam).
Top-level folders are for language families; you can find out more information by clicking on them.

Check out the [stripped](https://github.com/literallybenjam/langdev/tree/stripped) branch if you only want the machine-readable code without all those pesky READMEs and whatnot, and see the [wiki](https://github.com/literallybenjam/langdev/wiki) for general language information.
This branch contains development files alongside other reference materials used during development.
It might run a few commits behind [stripped](https://github.com/literallybenjam/langdev/tree/stripped) or the other branches from time to time.

LANGDEV uses [LexisML](https://github.com/literallybenjam/LexisML) to keep track of languages' lexicons.
Conversion from LexisML 1.0 to LexisML 2.0 is underway.

All files published to this git repositiory are, to the extent possible under law, in the public domain. For more information, see [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md).
