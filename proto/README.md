# THE PROTO-LANGUAGE

THE PROTO-LANGUAGE serves to provide the core roots, grammars, and systems for development of the language. It may be effectively utilized as a core for the development of sibling languages or for educational purposes. This document serves as a reference for various aspects of THE PROTO-LANGUAGE and its development.

Because it defines a proto-language, this document should be considered speculative, third-hand, and for reference purposes only.

### vowels

THE PROTO-LANGUAGE features five vowels:

- i: close front unrounded vowel
- a: (near-)open front unrounded vowel
- o: open back rounded vowel
- e: mid central unrounded vowel
- u: close back rounded vowel

There are also four diphthongs:

- ai
- au
- oi
- ua

Vowels can be either short or long (notated with a <i>:</i> after the vowel).

### accent

THE PROTO-LANGUAGE features a simple pitch-accent system in which the root of a word is always spoken at a higher pitch than any affixes. Accents, if marked, are transcribed via an acute accent over the vowel of the syllable; in the case of diphthongs, accents are placed over the <i>a</i> or (in the case of <i>oi</i>) the <i>i</i>. Accents are usually not marked for monosyllabic words.
