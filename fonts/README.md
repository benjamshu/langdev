#  The LANGDEV Font  #

This branch of the LANGDEV Project repository focuses on creating fonts which implement the specification set forth in [unicode](https://github.com/literallybenjam/langdev/tree/unicode/unicode).
Right now it is comprised of a single font, [Unifont LANGDEV](unifont), designed using the tools of [GNU Unifont](http://unifoundry.com/unifont.html).
