#  The LANGDEV Font  #

This branch of the LANGDEV Project repository focuses on creating fonts which implement the specification set forth in [unicode](https://github.com/literallybenjam/langdev/tree/unicode/unicode).
Right now it is comprised of a single font, [The LANGDEV Font](LANGDEV.std), designed with FontForge.
